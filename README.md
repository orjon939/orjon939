Hi, I'm Orjon! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at jCoders Academy, where I'm focusing on learning HTML and CSS to build responsive and user-friendly websites. My goal is to continue expanding my skills in web development and start building my own projects soon.

What I'm Learning:
HTML: Structure and content of web pages.
CSS: Styling and layout techniques for creating beautiful designs.
Feel free to check out my repositories to see the projects I'm working on! ðŸš€
